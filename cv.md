<p class="cvitem"> About me </p>

<p class="cvcontent">Hi! I am Ke YAN, a PhD candidate in Dept. Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua Univ., China. My advisor is Prof. David Zhang, IEEE fellow.</p> 
<p class="cvcontent">In my PhD work, I focus on analyzing electronic nose (e-nose) data with machine learning algorithms. For example, compensating sensor drift with transfer learning.</p>
