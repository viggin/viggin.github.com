<p class="cvitem"> About me </p>

<p class="cvcontent">Hi! I am Ke YAN from Beijing, China. Now I am a postdoc researcher in <u>National Institutes of Health, US</u>. My tutors are <a href="https://clinicalcenter.nih.gov/about/SeniorStaff/ronald_summers.html">Dr. Ronald Summers</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~lelu/">Dr. Le Lu</a>. My research interests include computer vision, deep learning, and machine learning. I am using <u>deep learning</u> methods to tackle difficult problems in <u>medical image analysis</u>.</p>
<p class="cvcontent">I got my Ph.D. and BS degrees both from Dept. Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, China. My advisor is <a href="http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csdzhang/"> Prof. David Zhang</a>, IEEE fellow. I am the winner of 2016 Tsinghua University Excellent Doctoral Dissertation Award.</p>
